hello world!
BitTorrent is a method of downloading big files. The big file is broken down into smaller parts and it automatically fetches parts from multiple hosts at once. It also shares the parts you've already downloaded with others, so that everybody shares and benefits. It is a good way to download Ubuntu iso releases, especially when the regular release sites are slow, since it actually gets faster when there are lots of users downloading and sharing at once
